	//Inheritance is inheriting properties of parent class into child class

	//DOG IS-A Animal
	//CAR IS-A Vehicle

	//Answer: extends keyword
	
	//Which entities do not take part in inheritance?

	//Java does not support multiple inheritance
	//Parent class is also known as super class and child class is also known as sub class
	
	//Levels of inheritance in java
	//1. Single inheritance. One child class extends one parent class
	//2. Multilevel inheritance - child extends Parent

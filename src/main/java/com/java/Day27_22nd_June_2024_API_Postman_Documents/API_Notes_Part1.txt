Early topics for API Testing using postman:-
------------------------------------------------

Create a Workspace in Postman
Create Collection(s) for that workspace
Create Request(http) GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE as per your requirements

in Case it is a GET Request then pass the url and wait for the server response which is known as the response payload 

check the status 200 OK or something else
check the time elapsed 155 ms or something else
also check the size of the response payload data 1.92KB or something else
make sure the Body Tab has the Pretty highlighted so that the response payload will look more readable in the JSON format
Cookies can also be validated which we will learn ahead in the course
Headers can also be validated which we will learn ahead in the course
Test Results can also be validated which we will learn ahead in the course


in case it is a POST Request then we pass the url, we pass the Request payload and the server will return a Response payload
the Request payload as an example is [click on raw radio button and select JSON from the dropdown]

{
    "name": "Sarthak",
    "job": "Automation Trainer"
}

and click on Send button

The Server will send a Response Payload as shown below
{
    "name": "Sarthak",
    "job": "Automation Trainer",
    "id": "755",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-28T11:00:03.696Z"
}

now if you want to UPDATE something then we have to create a PUT request
the url to be passed will be https://reqres.in/api/users/755     and the 755 comes from the id

{
    "name": "Sarthak",
    "job": "Automation Architect"
}


The updated Response Payload will look like this:-

{
    "name": "Sarthak",
    "job": "Automation Architect",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-28T11:10:04.838Z"
}

	/*In summary, encapsulation focuses on data hiding and controlling access to the internal state of objects, 
	while abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and providing a simplified view of objects and their behaviors. 
	Both concepts are essential for building robust and maintainable object-oriented systems. */
	
	//Mechanism of wrapping the data (variables / methods) together in a single unit 
	
	//1. Declare the variable as private [this is known as data hiding]
	//2. Design the setter and getter methods and make them as public

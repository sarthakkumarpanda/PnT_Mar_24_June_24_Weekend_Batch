	//Data
	//Arrays are part of Data Structures
	
	//Arrays are a very straight forward concept.
	//Arrays will store homogenous elements[data of same type]
	//Length of the array can be determined using length attribute
	//Size of the array is pre-determined
	//indexing position of an array starts from 0
	//arrays are represented in the form of a dimension []
	//Parent class of array is Object

		//1. Arrays can store multiple elements
		int a[] = {10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100};
		// int i = 1,2,3,4; - this is not allowed
		
		//2. We can access any element within the array because of the indexing concept
		//3. Unless you learn Arrays you will not be able to understand the concept of other Complex Data Structure entities
